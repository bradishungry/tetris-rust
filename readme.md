Tetris created in rust, using SDL2. In the future, I plan to have some sort of
machine learning algorithm for AI, just as a learning experience.

## Progress
**gfx-rs hal implementation**
-Event Loop <br />
-Sprite loading <br />
-Input and placement <br />
-Basic animation/rotation <br />
-Units and collision <br />
-Block spawns <br />
-Mechanics <br />
-Score <br />
-Animations for clearing lines <br />
-Difficulty <br />
-Multiplayer <br />
-Basic AI <br />

**OpenGL kind of broke with macOS Mojave so no more SDL**
